Hello!

Yes, this is the DocPac for now.

It was already a short week, and then the weather made it more whacky, and the weather hasn't decided if it's finished yet or not.

We will evaluate what are expectations are for this week's DocPac when we know when we will return the to building.

HOWEVER, it's still technically a working day, and we should know that our class uses Microsoft Teams to communicate and that we sync our DocPac repos the first day of the week.

Anyone who has been paying attention in class should know this, so I want to test to see how well I've reinforced this.

If you read this, and you message me on Teams to ackowledge you have read this the morning we come back to the building, I will give you 10 pogs.
